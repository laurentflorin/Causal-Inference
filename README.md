# Causal-Inference

effekt of offering german courses
people who moved to switzerland within the last 5 years, aged 18-64
treatment: offer of free lessons
shortterm outcome: taking the offer
longterm outcome: wage, probababilty/amount of social benefits

discontinuity design: only if earning less than 50000
matching: zürich vs someone with same characteristics outside of zürich



data set:
- age
- gender
- marital status
- permit class
- income
- education level
- zipcode
- country of origin
- social benefits (factor)
- course or not (factor)
- year of arrival
- work percentage
- no of children
- age of youngest child
- continue taking course

threats to identification:
- someone gets access to a german cours in a other way
--> non compliance
- attrition -> leave country (if those who leave the country are the ones that profit the least from the course, sample is biased)
